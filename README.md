# LYN-Encrypt

**LYN** (Layered Yet Nonlinear) is an encryption algorithm that enhances traditional block cipher 
design with dynamic substitution boxes and key-driven round control for stronger, more adaptable encryption.

##  Features

* 🔃 Dynamic substitution box (S-Box) generated from the encryption key
* 🔁 Variable number of rounds derived from the key hash
* 🔗 CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode with random IV
* ✅ SHA-256 checksum for data integrity verification
* 📦 PKCS#7 padding for proper block alignment

##  Usage

Run the tool:

python lyn_encryption.py
